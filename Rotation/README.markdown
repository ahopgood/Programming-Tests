# Rotation
You need to write a program that will return true if one string is a rotation of another.  
For example, "erbottlewat" is a rotation of "waterbottle".  

## Considerations:
* What is the complexity of your solution?
* Can you think of other solutions with less (or more) complexity?
* Can you think of a way to do this using only one call to a substring method?
